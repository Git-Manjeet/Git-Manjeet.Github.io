    <p>Re: Eileen Dover university application</p>

    <p>Miss Eileen Dover<br>
    4321 Cliff Top Edge<br>
    Dover CT9 XXX<br>
    UK</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections:</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://www.awesome.edu/university_dates">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-ended research facility – as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning 100 kg of gold into the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance (fast lap/qualifying) in racecars produced by cooling 300°C (572°F), when the outside temperature approximately increases (effect of 3°C to 5°C increase is 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
        <li>Rimfire and centerfire ignition for improved medical success</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance research</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of our post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physiological chicken dance<br>
        A little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC, a whole village would dance around in circles like chickens.</li>
        <li>Antarctic headspin<br>
        Modern Antarctic dance developed as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved headspins deep in the snow to flatten it out, and fluffing their heads to stay warm and inexplicably never getting snow on their heads. Twirling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another interesting example is the tribal miscommunication. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a hidden tribe of people who communicated by “wookie” styled movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northeast Alaska and Canada. Later however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were cold.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,<br>
    Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
